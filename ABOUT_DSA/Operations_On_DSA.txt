                Operations That we can perform on DSA are Mentioned below :::---

    1. Traversing
    2. Insertion 
    3. Deletion 
    4. Searching 
    5. merging 
    6. Sorting   

Let me Introduce All the Terms one By one :-

    1. Traversing :- Visiting Each and every elements atleast and atmost one time .

                     Visiting can be anything like Printing element ,Finding any element 
                     counting the numeber of elements etc.

    2. Insertion :- Adding an Elemtent in any Data structure

                    In Insertion we may see an error :- "Overflow"

            Overflow :--> Overflow means , When data structure Is full then further Insertion is 
                          not possible .

    3. Deletion :- Removing an element from Data structure

                    In Deletion we may see an error :- "Underflow"

            Underflow :--> Underflow means, When Data structure is Empty and no further Deletion is
                           is possible

    4. Searching :- Finding an element in data structure and return its location

        ===> Two Results are possible 

            1. Successful Search = Elemtent found

            2. Unsuccessful Search = Elemtent not found

    5. Merging :- Combine Twoo Data structure of same type into one 

    6. Sorting :- Arranging Data structure in either Ascending or descending order.
