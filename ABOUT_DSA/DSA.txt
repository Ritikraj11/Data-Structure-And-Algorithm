Definition of DSA :- Mathematical and Logical model of organising the interrelated data

                    Types of Data structure 

1. Linear :-  Array
              Linked List
              Queue
              Stack
2. Non-Linear :- Tree
                 Graph 
                 Table


                 Types of Data structure(Based on Uses)

1. Container --> Array 
                 Linked List

2. Indexing Class --> Binary Search Tree
                      AVL Tree
                      Hash Table

3. Priorities --> Stack
                  Queue
                  Heap


        Now there is one question arises that Why Data structure ?

    --> So The answer is Very simple , Data structure helps us in such way that input , output and the 
        intermediate result can be accesed or generated in minimum efforts .

        Note :- Best selection of data structure is important
